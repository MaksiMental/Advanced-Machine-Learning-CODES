For exercises in general: 
- No mandatory hand-ins, voluntary participation, but all lectures and exercises are relevant for to exam
- Help each other! Teaching others is the best form of learning
- Bertram, Christian, and Stefan are here to help
- Exercises should help you to learn - don't hesitate to find a work setting or extend with other material that works better for you 

Exercises are group work
- Exercises best done in pairs of 2-3 people
- Try to gather in **different groups** every now and then


## Task 1: Set up your programming environment
- Make sure that the test tasks in W00-preparations do work.

Brush up some knowledge on:
- Python-IDEs
- Git


## Optional Task 2: Grasp some basics on jupyter notebooks
via *E01_revisions_jupyter_notebook.ipynb* in your local python/Jupyter-notebook environment: explore!


## Optional Task 3: Recap basics of data processing and visualisation 
via *E01_revisions_data_basics.ipynb* in your local python environment:
- Test different properties of numpy-arrays vs. pandas-dataframes accessing & -indexing, conversion, computations & basic statistics,
- Explore the scipy library for interesting analysis functions,
- Inspect plotting options in matplotlib & seaborn, and get familiar with controlling the output graphs by modifying: appearances and information.


## Optional Task 4: Browse through Colab:
https://colab.research.google.com/

- Get familiar with the colab ecosystem,
- Create a Jupyter notebook in your colab space and run the same code example.


## Optional Task 5: Recap Kevin Murphy's Colab example:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/probml-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/colab_intro.ipynb

Focus on:
- plotting, 
- data processing.

Leave out for now:
- JAX,
- Tensorflow,
- PyTorch,
- Hardware accelerators.
